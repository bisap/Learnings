<b>A foundation for DevOps</b>
Infrastructure as code is the prerequisite for common DevOps practices such as version control, code review, continuous integration and automated testing. These practices get you to continuous delivery of quality software that pleases your customers.

Many IT teams still rely on manual configurations, custom scripts, golden images or outdated tools to manage infrastructure, resulting in errors and slow deployments. Organizations looking for faster deployments treat infrastructure like software: as code that can be managed with the same tools and processes software developers use, such as version control, continuous integration, code review and automated testing. These let you make infrastructure changes more easily, rapidly, safely and reliably.
