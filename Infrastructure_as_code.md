<b>A foundation for DevOps</b>
Infrastructure as code is the prerequisite for common DevOps practices such as version control, code review, continuous integration and automated testing. These practices get you to continuous delivery of quality software that pleases your customers.
<br />
Many IT teams still rely on manual configurations, custom scripts, golden images or outdated tools to manage infrastructure, resulting in errors and slow deployments. Organizations looking for faster deployments treat infrastructure like software: as code that can be managed with the same tools and processes software developers use, such as version control, continuous integration, code review and automated testing. These let you make infrastructure changes more easily, rapidly, safely and reliably.

<b>Benefits of infrastructure as code</b>
Software developers can use code to provision and deploy servers and applications, rather than rely on system administrators in a DevOps environment. A developer might write an infrastructure-as-code process to provision and deploy a new application for quality assurance or experimental deployment before operations takes over for live deployment in production.

With the infrastructure setup written as code, it can go through the same version control, automated testing, and other steps of a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline that developers use for application code. An organization may choose to combine infrastructure as code with containers

Despite its benefits, infrastructure as code poses potential disadvantages. It requires additional tools, such as a configuration management system.

<br />
If administrators change server configurations outside of the set infrastructure-as-code template, there is potential for configuration drift. It's important to fully integrate infrastructure as code into systems administration, IT operations and DevOps practices with well-documented policies and procedures.
