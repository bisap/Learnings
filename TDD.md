<b>What is Test Driven Development (TDD)? <b>
  TDD can be defined as a programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. TDD means “Test Driven Development”. The primary goal of TDD is to make the code clearer, simple and bug-free.

Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application. In TDD approach, first, the test is developed which specifies and validates what the code will do.

In the normal Software Testing process, we first generate the code and then test. Tests might fail since tests are developed even before the development. In order to pass the test, the development team has to develop and refactors the code. Refactoring a code means changing some code without affecting its behavior.

The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). This helps to avoid duplication of code as we write a small amount of code at a time in order to pass tests. (Tests are nothing but requirement conditions that we need to test to fulfill them).

Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running automated test before actual development of the application. Hence, TDD sometimes also called as Test First Development.


How to perform TDD Test
Following steps define how to perform TDD test,

Add a test.
Run all tests and see if any new test fails.
Write some code.
Run tests and Refactor code.
Repeat.

TDD cycle defines

Write a test
Make it run.
Change the code to make it right i.e. Refactor.
Repeat process.


Advantages of TDD
Early bug notification.
Developers test their code but in the database world, this often consists of manual tests or one-off scripts. Using TDD you build up, over time, a suite of automated tests that you and any other developer can rerun at will.

Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code.
It helps to understand how the code will be used and how it interacts with other modules.
It results in better design decision and more maintainable code.
TDD allows writing smaller code having single responsibility rather than monolithic procedures with multiple responsibilities. This makes the code simpler to understand.
TDD also forces to write only production code to pass tests based on user requirements.
Confidence to Refactor
If you refactor code, there can be possibilities of breaks in the code. So having a set of automated tests you can fix those breaks before release. Proper warning will be given if breaks found when automated tests are used.
Using TDD, should results in faster, more extensible code with fewer bugs that can be updated with minimal risks.
Good for teamwork
In the absence of any team member, other team members can easily pick up and work on the code. It also aids knowledge sharing, thereby making the team more effective overall.

Good for Developers
Though developers have to spend more time in writing TDD test cases, it takes
