What is LDAP?
LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is an open and cross platform protocol used for directory services authentication.

LDAP provides the communication language that applications use to communicate with other directory services servers. Directory services store the users, passwords, and computer accounts, and share that information with other entities on the network.

<b>What is Active Directory?</b>
Active Directory is a directory services implementation that provides all sorts of functionality like authentication, group and user management, policy administration and more.

LDAP vs. Active Directory
LDAP is a way of speaking to Active Directory.

LDAP is a protocol that many different directory services and access management solutions can understand.

The relationship between AD and LDAP is much like the relationship between Apache and HTTP:

HTTP is a web protocol.
Apache is a web server that uses the HTTP protocol.
LDAP is a directory services protocol.
Active Directory is a directory server that uses the LDAP protocol.
