<ul>
  <li>With multi-stage builds, you use multiple FROM statements in your Dockerfile. Each FROM instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build. You can selectively copy artifacts from one stage to another, leaving behind everything you donâ€™t want in the final image,The end result is the same tiny production image as before, with a significant reduction in complexity</li>
  <li> Only runtime artifacts that we need from our previous  stages</li>  
</ul>
